## About this Project

In this project, you'll build an image gallery using React and the Flickr API. After creating the project with create-react-app, you will build the gallery components, add to the supplied CSS and set up routing.

- (Recommended) Use the flickr.photos.search endpoint/method
- Display at least 3 links that return a list of photos matching some criteria. For example: Dogs, Cats and Coffee.
- Include a "Search" link that includes a search field to let users search for photos.
- Use React Router to set up routes for each navigation link in the directory app.
- You can use the Fetch API or a tool like Axios to fetch data from the Flickr API.
- You should do all data fetching from a container component that passes the data down to presentational components responsible for displaying images

Have a basic understanding of React, React Router and APIs. See the Resources links on this page to find out more.
- Use a React component lifecycle method to fetch data immediately when the app loads. For example, if the root '/' path is 'Hiking', the app should display hiking images when it loads in the browser.
- Use a React component lifecycle method to fetch data when the routes change. For example, if a user clicks the 'Cats' navigation link, the app will fetch and display cat images from Flickr.

## Project Instruction

1. Set up your project with create-react-app
2. Build your app components
  - Most components should be stateless functional components that focus on the UI rather than behavior. Here's some examples of the sorts of components you’ll need:
    - A Container component that takes in a keyword and api key as props, and fetches the photos and other required information from the API
    - A Header component, maybe for storing the nav and search
    - A Navigation menu component
    - A Form component for the search
    - A Gallery component that can be reused to display the sets of images for each category you wish to display. For example, Sunsets, Flowers, and Waterfalls.
    - And you can even use a components for your list items and/or your individual images.
3. CSS styles
  - Update the CSS to style the app in a way that resembles the mockups.
Note: Remember, the mockups are just a general guide for how the elements should be arranged and positioned on the page. But other than general arrangement, spacing and positioning, you are free get creative with color and other cool CSS embellishments like shadows, transitions, fonts, etc.

4. Routes
  - Install React Router and set up your <Route> and <Link> or <NavLink> components.
  - Clicking a nav link should navigate the user to the correct route and load new data.
  - URLs should correctly match the Routes.

5. Get a Flickr API key
  - Create yahoo account/use tumblr account to sign in.
  - Apply for non-commercial API key https://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/apply/.
  - You’ll need to set up a config.js file in your project that imports your API key into your application so that you and other users can request data from the Flickr API.
  - The config.js file should look something like this:
    ```
    const apiKey = 'YOUR API KEY';
    export default apiKey;
    ```
  - Import your API key into your application and save it to a variable like you would any other module, and use the variable where applicable. That way, your app’s users will only need to enter in an API key once.

Important Note: This config.js file must be listed in the .gitignore file so it won’t be committed to your github repository. This will prevent your keys and tokens from getting posted publicly to GitHub. It is very important that you do NOT upload any of your personal API keys / secrets / passwords to Github or other publicly accessible place. When you submit this project for grading, your project reviewer will create their own config.js file and use their own API key to run the project.

6. Requesting the data
  - Fetch the data from the Flickr API.
  - Make sure data fetching and state is managed by a higher-level “container” component.
  - It is recommended the you use the following link for help with this part of the project, https://www.flickr.com/services/api/explore/flickr.photos.search.
    - Enter a tag to search for, such as “sunsets.”
    - You may also want to limit the number of results using the per_page argument.
    - Choose JSON as the output, then “Do not sign call.”
    - Click “Call Method...” At the bottom of the page, and you’ll see an example of the API call you’ll need to make. You can click on the URL to see what the response will look like.

7. Displaying the data
  - Make sure each image gets a unique "key" prop.
  - There should be no console warnings regarding unique "key" props.
  - The title of each image list should be displayed dynamically via "props".
  - The URL should match the route.

8. Search
  - Add search field feature to search for new categories of images.
  - Ideally, the search field should be visible only in the 'Search' route.

### Extra Credit
- Add a loading indicator that displays each time the app fetches new data.
- Include a 404-like error route that displays when a URL path does not match a route.
- If no matches are found by the search, include a message to tell the user there are no matches.
